# thegrid

This is a repository for an idea for a game I had. I'm not sure when I'll be able to earnestly work on it, but I wanted to put down the idea somewhere before it slips away. 

The grid is a multiplayer game based on the ancient game of Go. The rules: 

- The game can be played by up to 5 players on a grid board (200 x 200)
- Each player is assigned a color. At the start of the game, each player has 4 stones to place on the board. Then, each player gets a new stone 30 seconds after placing the last stone
- stones start to decay as soon as placed on the board, and lose about 10% of their density every 30 seconds, until they vanish completely. This last rule is to prevent the formation of permanently safe territories, which are common in Go.
